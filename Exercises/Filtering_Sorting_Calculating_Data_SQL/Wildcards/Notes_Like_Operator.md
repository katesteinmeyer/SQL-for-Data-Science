Key Points of the SQL LIKE Operator
Pattern Matching:

The LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
It is commonly used with string data types.
Wildcards:

The LIKE operator is typically used with two wildcards:
% (percent sign): Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
_ (underscore): Represents a single character.
Usage with WHERE Clause:

The LIKE operator is used in the WHERE clause to filter records based on a pattern.
Case Sensitivity:

The case sensitivity of the LIKE operator depends on the database system.
Some databases, like MySQL, are case-insensitive by default, while others, like PostgreSQL, are case-sensitive.

Common Patterns:

Starts with a specific pattern:

SELECT * FROM TableName
WHERE ColumnName LIKE 'pattern%';

Ends with a specific pattern:

SELECT * FROM TableName
WHERE ColumnName LIKE '%pattern';

Contains a specific pattern:

SELECT * FROM TableName
WHERE ColumnName LIKE '%pattern%';

Single character match:

SELECT * FROM TableName
WHERE ColumnName LIKE 'p_ttern';

Examples Using the Chinook Database:

1. Find Tracks Whose Names Start with "A"

SELECT *
FROM Track
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';

2. Find Tracks Whose Names Contain "Love"

SELECT *
FROM Track
WHERE Name LIKE '%Love%';

3. Find Tracks Whose Names End with "ing"

SELECT *
FROM Track
WHERE Name LIKE '%ing';

4. Find Tracks Whose Names Have "r" as the Second Character
SELECT *
FROM Track
WHERE Name LIKE '_r%';

Summary
%: Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
Example: 'A%' matches any string that starts with "A".
_: Represents a single character.
Example: 'p_ttern' matches "pattern" or "pottern" but not "ppattern".
Case Sensitivity: Varies by database system (MySQL is case-insensitive, PostgreSQL is case-sensitive by default).

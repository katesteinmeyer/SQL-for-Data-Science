A primary key is a crucial concept in database design. Here's a detailed explanation:

Primary Key:

Purpose: A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Characteristics:
Must contain unique values.
Cannot contain NULL values.
Each table can have only one primary key.
Often serves as a reference for foreign keys in other tables, establishing relationships between tables.
Importance:

Uniqueness: Ensures that each record can be uniquely identified, preventing duplicate rows.

Indexing: Automatically creates an index, which improves query performance.

Data Integrity: Maintains the integrity of the data by enforcing unique and non-null constraints on the primary key column(s).

Relationship: Facilitates the establishment of relationships between tables through foreign keys.
